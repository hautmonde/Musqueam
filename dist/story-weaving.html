I was at a longhouse last winter, and I had a young man come up and It’s exciting to see some of the really young girls now start to take an interest in the weaving, too. I was at my brother’s house about a month ago. I didn’t know this, but his daughter, his youngest daughter, had actually made a small little weaving.</p><p>I don’t know who taught her. It must have been one of his sisters. He was so proud of it he had it hanging on his wall. I remember feeling emotional going out to Richmond when my sisters had been working with the Vancouver Airport on a weaving project. I like knowing that the weaving is there.</p><p>Even when I think about it now, I get emotional because I just think about all of the people who went before me, all of the women, and of course the men, who helped with carving all the different tools. I wish we could bring back some of the women so that they could see the respect that people are giving Salish weaving.</p><p>It is such a spiritual feeling, to feel those blankets that are a hundred and fifty years old, and to know that the skill you’re reacquiring is the same that your ancestors had. It is about having a connection with the past, being able to have pride in who you are today, and having that connection acknowledged. In the first school, we sure spent a lot of time out at the Museum of Anthropology, just looking. I am really appreciative of the museum. I have been criticised sometimes for talking about the need for museums, but if we didn’t have museums those blankets wouldn’t have been protected and saved. We couldn’t come back a hundred years later to look at them and try and replicate them.</p><p>It is kind of special to me to see the picture of Selisya, because she was my grandfather’s great-aunt, and because my cousin carries her name. That ancestral knowledge is there. There is a very strong spiritual side to it. You get messages and directions, and you don’t always know why. I am sure that Selisya had a hand in ensuring that her descendants became a part of something that must have been very special to her. To know that her great grand-nieces are now so instrumental is really a very special gift from the Creator. It’s not about me, or Debbie, or Robyn. It is the Creator that has given us this great gift, and we have to acknowledge it, and protect it, and ensure that other people do that as well.</p></section></body></html>
